# Metrics, Logs, Traces and Profiles with Grafana LGTM

## Introduction

Do you have too many monitoring tools and find yourself moving between different tabs or products when troubleshooting?

With Grafana LGTM stack, we could improve our observability with: Loki-for logs, Grafana - for dashboards and visualization, Tempo - for traces, and Mimir - for metrics.

We will walk you through how to get started with Grafana, including installation with AlviStack DevOps solution, building your first Grafana dashboard, and how you can connect to a wide range of data sources, regardless of where it resides, to get a unified view of your data in a single dashboard.
